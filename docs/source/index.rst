Welcome to PyU4V's documentation!
=================================

Overview
--------

PyU4V is a Python module that simplifies interaction with the Unisphere for
PowerMax REST API.  It wraps REST calls with simple APIs that abstract the HTTP
request and response handling.

.. note::
   All official documentation for Unipshere for PowerMax API
   is available at https://developer.dell.com/apis/4458. An OpenApi.json file
   can be download from this site for use with tools like PostMan or for
   interfacing with PyU4V custom API call mechanism.  Please refer to this
   documentation when looking for information about query path parameters
   for functions that accept them.

Build your own PyU4V Docs
-------------------------

PyU4V docs have been built using Sphinx and included with the source PyU4V
package, however if you would like to build the docs from scratch use the
following commands::

   $ pip install sphinx
   $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
   $ cd PyU4V/docs
   $ make clean && make html

All of the necessary make files and sphinx configuration files are included
with PyU4V so you can build the docs after the required dependencies have been
installed.

Once the above commands have been run you will find newly generated html files
within the ``/PyU4V/docs/build`` folder. Open ``index.html`` within a
browser of your choosing to view the docs offline. Generating the docs is not
required, we have bundled the most up-to-date docs with PyU4V so you can still
navigate to ``/PyU4V/docs/build/index.html`` within your browser to view
PyU4V docs offline.
