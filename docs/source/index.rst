Welcome to PyU4V's documentation!
=================================

Overview
--------

PyU4V is a Python module that simplifies interaction with the Unisphere for
PowerMax REST API.  It wraps REST calls with simple APIs that abstract the HTTP
request and response handling.

.. note::
   You can get the Unisphere for PowerMax REST documentation by
   navigating to a URL in your local instance of Unisphere for PowerMax.
   Navigate to ``https://{ip}:{port}/univmax/restapi/docs`` where ``{ip}`` is
   the IP address of your Unisphere server and ``{port}`` is the port it is
   listening on. A zip file will be downloaded to your computer containing
   complete Unisphere REST endpoint documentation.

.. note::
    If you want to continue to use Unisphere 8.4.x or 9.0.x with PyU4V you will
    need to remain on PyU4V 3.1.x. There is no support for PyU4V 9.1 with any
    version of Unisphere older than 9.1.x

.. note::
    PyU4V officially supports Python 3.6 & 3.7, Python 2.x support has been
    dropped as it will soon be retired_.

.. note::
    PyU4V version 9.1.x is compatible with scripts written for PyU4V versions
    >= 3.x, there is **zero** support or compatibility for PyU4V 2.x or earlier
    scripts in later versions of PyU4V. If you have scripts written which
    specifically target Unisphere REST 8.4 or 9.0 endpoints these are still
    accessible via PyU4V 9.1.x however you will need to ensure you are passing
    the version required when performing these calls as PyU4V 9.1 will default
    to using 9.1 endpoints exclusively. You will also need to pay special
    attention to any REST JSON payloads in custom scripts as payloads are
    subject to change between major Unisphere REST releases.

Build your own PyU4V Docs
-------------------------

PyU4V docs have been built using Sphinx and included with the source PyU4V
package, however if you would like to build the docs from scratch use the
following commands::

   $ pip install sphinx
   $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
   $ cd PyU4V/docs
   $ make clean && make html

All of the necessary make files and sphinx configuration files are included
with PyU4V so you can build the docs after the required dependencies have been
installed.

Once the above commands have been run you will find newly generated html files
within the ``/PyU4V/docs/build/html`` folder. Open ``index.html`` within a
browser of your choosing to view the docs offline. Generating the docs is not
required, we have bundled the most up-to-date docs with PyU4V so you can still
navigate to ``/PyU4V/docs/build/html/index.html`` within your browser to view
PyU4V docs offline.
