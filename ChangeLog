  calls are accessed through PyU4V.performance.real_time. All Unisphere for
  PowerMax real-time categories and metrics are supported.

Documentation
-------------
- Code examples have been moved to docs/source/programmers_guide_src/code
  for ease of reference in main documentation
- Programmers Guide Examples section has been re-structured for ease of
  navigation.

Miscellaneous

Version 9.1.5.0 - released 21/09/20
===================================
Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug in performance CI tests where tests would fail if there was no
  provisioned assets in certain performance categories. The tests will skip now
  instead of failing.


Version 9.1.4.0 - released 09/09/20
===================================
Bug Fixes
---------
- GitHub Issue #93 (https://github.com/dell/PyU4V/issues/93) has been resolved.
  Users can now create storage groups with volumes in the same request where no
  service level has been specified as an input parmaeter or service level is
  set to None. In addition, another bug found whilst fixing #93 whereby storage
  groups with no service level set were created with no storage resource pool
  regardless of user input parameter value.
- GitHub Issue #92 (https://github.com/dell/PyU4V/issues/92) has been resolved.
  User documentation has been updated to correct the error in the path to
  set a custom PyU4V.conf location.


Version Control
---------------
- Pep8 test suite flake8 package version has been upgraded to 3.8.3
- Pylint test suite package version has been upgraded to 2.5.3

Quality Control
---------------
- The change to Pylint version resulted in more stringent code analysis, as
  such a number of changes were made in the following files to bring the code
  rating back up to 10.0/10.0:
    - PyU4V/common.py
    - PyU4V/performance.py

Version 9.1.2.0 - released 19/12/19
===================================
Provisioning Enhancements
-------------------------
- add_new_volume_to_storage_group : added functionality to be able to add
  volumes to SRDF protected storage groups, new volumes will automatically be
  protected with SRDF, volumes are added to the remote storage group to fully
  automate the provisioning and simplify operations. Storage group must be
  local to the unisphere instance and only works with storage groups that
  contain R1 or R11 devices.
- remove_volume_from_storage_group enhanced to be able to automatically remove
  volumes from local and remote storage groups deleting srdf pairs as part of
  the process, no need to suspend, the automation takes care of everything,
  storage group must be local to the unisphere instance and only works with
  storage groups that contain R1 or R11 devices.

Version 9.1.0.0 - released 4/12/19
==================================

Enhancements
------------
- Changed from MIT License to Apache 2.0 License
- Python 2.7 has been removed as a supported Python version in advance of
  discontinued community support
- Doc strings have been standardised through out PyU4V
- Snake case has been implemented across method names and old methods set for
  deprecation (see refactoring/deprecation list below)
- Unisphere version has been moved from a user-set variable to a constant set
  by PyU4V.
- If the user does not supply environment settings or they cannot be loaded
  from the config file an exception is raised during initialisation of
  U4VConn()
- Imports have been correctly implemented so class instances are not passed
  around except for the rest_client
- List/Dict comprehension have been cleaned up
- Decorators have been created for deprecating/refactoring methods, see section
  'Refactoring & Deprecation' below
- Methods have been changed from old build_uri method to new build_uri method
  so there are zero hard coded endpoints
- Workload Planner functions have been moved out of common.py and into their
  own file workload_planner.py
- File handling functions have been moved to utils.file_handler.py
- Added .gitignore file to prevent any unwanted files merging with upstream
  repo
- Logger log level now only set in one place in PyU4V.conf
- Logger rotating file handler set up to create log files no bigger than 10MB
  and rotate through 10 of them with the most recent always being PyU4V.log
- Separate handling of SSLError, Timeout, HTTPError, and ConnectionError REST
  exceptions, allows for more granularity when diagnosing problems
- PyU4V will run a Unisphere validation check in U4VConn() __init__, if the
  version does not meet the required minimum set the driver gracefully exits
- A new REST header has been added called user-agent which specifies the
  current version of PyU4V in use, the platform running it and release
  information, and the Python version in use
- System endpoints have been added to PyU4V, enhancements feature system health
  checks, disk, and tag information
- Users can write dictionary to CSV from utils.file_handler
- CSV reader can convert string representations of boolean and float values to
  the correct type for processing
- Page list iterator now can iterate through all pages automatically, merge all
  results into one list and return to the user
- Performance section had a complete overhaul, from top to bottom it is an
  entirely new section. Old methods have been fixed but all marked for
  deprecation. For more information see 'Refactoring & Deprecation' section
  below
- Performance constants have been moved out of the package wide constants file
  into their own performance_constants file
- PyU4V README and ReadTheDocs had a complete overhaul from their previous
  state and can be considered complete revisions
- Retry decorator added to decorators.py to allow functions to be attempted
  multiple times before failing.
- Check if a given string is a valid ipv4 or ipv6 address
- Functions now expect integer numbers instead of string representations of
  numbers expected by the Unisphere REST API, the intention is to make the use
  of PyU4V as simple as possible and let us take care of casting required types
- Online Device Expansion is included presenting users with the ability to
  extend R2 devices in the same operation as extending R1 devices.

Provisioning Enhancements
-------------------------
- get_available_initiator_wwn_as_list() : Get a list of available initiator
  WWNs
- get_in_use_initiator() : Get an initiator that is in use filterable by
  director type
- get_available_initiator() : Get an available initiator filterable by director
  type
- get_fa_directors() : Get all FA directors on the array.
- get_active_masking_view_connections() : Get list of active connections from
  any masking view
- format_director_port : Format separate director port into single string
- get_any_director_port : Get a non-GuestOS port from a director


Fixes
-----
- When searching for volumes by volume name, if more than one volume matches
  the input volume name a list of volume device IDs will be returned, if only
  one volume is matched just that device ID is returned as a string
- Fix for establishing a session when none exists during rest requests
- PyU4V.conf loading on Windows from user home directory now working as
  intended from default location of ~/.PyU4V
- Removed CFG from header of univmax_conn.py and set it in __init__ so users
  file_path is now read as intended
- Removed CFG from header of utils files, it was unnecessary to have it
  included there, it only needs set once in U4VConn()
- The function migration.get_storage_group_list() set includeMigrations to
  False incorrectly returns all SGs in the migratingNames list, a new function
  migration.get_storage_groups() has been added which returns the default
  response of a dict containing all SG names and those SGs which are part of a
  migration session
- The function migration.delete_environment() was deleted as it is a duplicate
  of function migration.delete_migration_environment()
- CSV writer has been changed to use correct file writing modes and practices
- Pull #30 Modify initiator reverses alias name during a rename operation
- Pull #34 Get target wwn fails to split director:port return value
- Pull #38 Incorrect type in docstring of get_size_of_device_on_array
- Split returned port ids correctly during port group create/modify operations.

Tests
-----
- 100% unit test coverage with all tests running cleanly across both unit and
  CI
- All suitable functions now have a respective Continuous Integration (CI) test
- Extensive CI test coverage
- Requests session establish is tested instead of mocking behaviour
- Fake request session mock has been changed so it does not adversely affect
  other tests when full suite of tests is run

Refactoring & Deprecations
--------------------------
The following methods have either been refactored and marked for deprecation
after PyU4V 9.3 or just marked for deprecation with no refactoring. To reduce
the impact on end-users which may use these methods in their scripts an n+2
deprecation policy has been adopted.

For any methods marked for deprecation in the current release, they will need
to remain in PyU4V for two full releases before being completely removed.  As
this policy has only just been implemented for PyU4V 9.1, all methods below
marked for deprecation after PyU4V 9.3 will be removed entirely in PyU4V 9.4 or
whatever the equivalent version is for n+2.

It is assumed that after two full releases users will have had enough time and
notice to make the required changes in their code. Any methods which have been
refactored in favour of other methods will be clearly marked in the associated
logs generated when a refactored function is in use.
